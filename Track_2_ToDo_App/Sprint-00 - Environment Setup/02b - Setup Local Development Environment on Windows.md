- Uncheck _Launch Visual Studio Code_ and click _Finish_ to close the installer.

## Install Python

If you haven't already installed Python locally on your computer, follow instructions below to install Python.

- Download latest stable release of Python [by clicking here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.2/python-3.12.2-amd64.exe).
- Go to the local Downloads folder and click on Python installer file

## Setup Python Virtual Environment

1. From the terminal window, navigate to the project directory

    ```bash
    cd <project directory>
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > The repository for this training has a directory named `myApplication` that you can use as your default working directory while building the application or feel free to choose any directory where you would like to put this application.

2. Copy the following `requirements.txt` file from [Sprint 0](/Track_2_ToDo_App/Sprint-00%20-%20Environment%20Setup/src/requirements.txt) into your project directory.

3. Open up Visual Studio Code in the project directory by executing the following command.

    ```cmd
    code . 
    ```

4. From Visual Studio Code, either select "View/Command Palette" or press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette.
![Command Palette](/Track_2_ToDo_App/Sprint-00%20-%20Environment%20Setup/images/SetupVirtualEnvrionment-01.png)

5. In the search box, type `Python` and then select the option `Python: Create Environement...` from the list of options.
![Create Environment](/Track_2_ToDo_App/Sprint-00%20-%20Environment%20Setup/images/SetupVirtualEnvrionment-02.png)

6. An environment type selection box will appear. Select `Venv Create a '.venv' environment in the current workspace` from the list of options.
![Select Environment Type](/Track_2_ToDo_App/Sprint-00%20-%20Environment%20Setup/images/SetupVirtualEnvrionment-03.png)

7. Select the Python interpreter version to use for the virtual environment.  If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you should select the version that you installed in the previous step.
![Select Python Interpreter](/Track_2_ToDo_App/Sprint-00%20-%20Environment%20Setup/images/SetupVirtualEnvrionment-04.png)

8. Check the box next to the `requirements.txt` file to install the required packages in the virtual environment and hit ok.
![Install Required Packages](/Track_2_ToDo_App/Sprint-00%20-%20Environment%20Setup/images/SetupVirtualEnvrionment-05.png)

9. You will see a notification in the bottom right corner of the screen indicating that the virutal environment is being created.  This can take a few minutes to complete.
![Virtual Environment Creation](/Track_2_ToDo_App/Sprint-00%20-%20Environment%20Setup/images/SetupVirtualEnvrionment-06.png)

10. Once the virtual environment is created, you should see a notification in the bottom right corner of the screen indicating that the virtual environment has been created. 
    This will create a new directory called `.venv` in the project directory that will contain the virtual environment.  All python packages installed in this environment will be isolated from the global python environment.

11. Open up a terminal window in Visual Studio Code and activate the virtual environment by running the following command.

    ```cmd
    .venv\Scripts\Activate
    ```

    You should see the name of the virtual environment in the terminal prompt to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

## Install Python Libraries

Code examples in some of the sprints uses following Python libraries. If these modules are not already installed, install these libraries by following the instructions below.  Note however if you have already installed the virtual environment, you can skip this step as the libraries were installed as part of the virtual environment setup.

1. Open Visual Studio Code if it is already not open
2. Open Terminal window or Create a new terminal window in VS Code
3. Make sure __*pip*__ package manager installed in VS Code to install Python libraries. If not installed, follow the instructions below.

    - Download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)
    - Run below command in the VS Code terminal window
  
    ```python
    python <Local folder path>\get-pip.py  
    ```
  
4. Copy the following `requirements.txt` file from [Sprint 0](/Track_2_ToDo_App/Sprint-00%20-%20Environment%20Setup/src/requirements.txt) into your project directory.

5. Now, install the required libraries by running the following command in the terminal window:

    ```python
    pip install requirements.txt
    ```
