<details>
<summary>What is GitHub?</summary>

GitHub is actually two things: **Git** and **Hub**.

**Git** is a version control software. It allows developers to work on a specific project at the same time by tracking the changes. If something goes wrong, you can easily undo the changes with Git.
**Hub** is nothing special in itself, but it represents the "social network" of developers built on top of Git. While GitHub does not own the Git software, it has created a platform that makes it easy to access and collaborate with Git. The groundbreaking feature of GitHub is that it makes it super easy to share/show your code with the world or just store it. You no longer have to worry about where you store your code. Companies have GitHub accounts for the same reason. GitHub provides an easy way to store your code online with built-in version control.

You have now successfully created your GitHub account. Now it is time to edit your profile and make it your own.

## Edit your GitHub profile

## Fork Repository

A Fork is a copy of a repository in your own GitHub account. This is extremely handy if you want to freely experiment without making any changes to the original project.

Now, let's go ahead and fork this repository!
