‚è≤Ô∏è _Est. time to complete: 10 min._ ‚è≤Ô∏è

## User Story

*As a user, I want to be able to have my to-do list automatically loaded from a file when I start the program.*

## üéØAcceptance Criteria:
- Existing to-do list items from when I ran the program last are loaded into this program
- The existing to-do list items will be a ".txt" file
- each line in the file will contain a single to-do item.
- if there is no file, then the program should load an empty collection

## üéìKnow Before You Start
The following resources/videos will help you get a better understanding of some of the basic Python concepts that you will use to complete this user story.

## üìãSteps

In order to complete this user story you will need to complete the following tasks

#### 1. Open Visual Studio Code
- Go to your application directory and start visual studio code by typing `code .` in the terminal window and pressing enter.

- Open the `app.py` file in the root of your project folder.

<br/>

#### 2. Update code to load to-do list from file on start
The first change that we will need to make to the code is to update the logic for the start of the program. We will need to add code that will load the to-do list from a file when the program starts.  Add the following code to the beginning of the program, right after the `todo_list = []` statement:

![insertcode](/Track_2_ToDo_App/Sprint-01%20-%20Basic%20Application/images/InsertCode-S1-F2-US02-01.png)

>[!TIP]
>You can ask GitHub Copilot to help here with this prompt *load todo list from todo_list.txt file*

```python
try:
    with open("todo_list.txt", "r") as file:
        for line in file:
            todo_list.append(line.strip())
except FileNotFoundError:
    pass
```

This code will open a file named `todo_list.txt` in the current directory and read each line from the file.  The `r` parameter in the `open` function tells Python to open the file in read mode.  The `for` loop will iterate through each line in the file and add it to the `todo_list`.  The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the line before adding it to the `todo_list`.  If the file does not exist, the `except FileNotFoundError` block will catch the error and the program will continue without loading any items.

<br/>

#### 3. Run the application
Now let's see this application in action. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder where your `app.py` file is located. Run the application by typing `python app.py` and pressing the enter key or simply click the play button in the top right corner of the Visual Studio Code window.

- When you start the program you should automatically see the list of to-do items that were previously saved in the file.
