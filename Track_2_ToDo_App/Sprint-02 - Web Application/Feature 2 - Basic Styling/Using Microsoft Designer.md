## What Needs to Done
In this step-by-step guide, you will learn how to use Microsoft Designer to create a background image for your web application.

## üìã Steps

In order to complete this user story you will need to complete the following tasks:

#### 1. Open Microsoft Designer
Open Microsoft Designer going to [**https://designer.microsoft.com**](https://designer.microsoft.com) in your browser.  You should get a web page that looks something like this:

![Microsoft Designer](/Track_2_ToDo_App/Sprint-02%20-%20Web%20Application/images/designer-01.png)

<br/>

#### 2. Pick an Image
Click on one of the pictures.  In this case I am clicking on the Easter Bunny.

<br/>

You will then see a screen that looks like this.  You can simply edit some of the fields that they are showing or you can completely customize the text.  For this example I clicked on the ```Edit Entire Prompt``` link to make changes to the image.

<br/>

#### 3. Edit the Prompt
That will make all of the text editable. Like below.

I then modified that prompt with a few variations to try and make it fit this scenario.  However, you should feel free to tweak the prompt as much as you want, or just start with a fresh prompt.  Not the red underlines attempt to show the changes that I made to the prompt.

#### 4. Generate the Image
6. Click on the `Generate` button and within a few minutes you should be give a few images that were created from your prompt.  Here are a few examples of what I was given.

<br/>

#### 5. Download the Image
I decided that I wanted the picture on the right, so I simply clicked on it and was presented with this page.
    
![Microsoft Designer7](/Track_2_ToDo_App/Sprint-02%20-%20Web%20Application/images/designer-07.png)

I then clicked on the `Download` button which presents another set of options.  I hit the `Download` button again (the one that the red arrow is pointing to in the picture) and this will save it to the default `Download` location on your computer.  Navigate to that folder and then move it to the `static/images` folder of your application. Be aware of the name as you will need to update the .css file to point to the new image.
