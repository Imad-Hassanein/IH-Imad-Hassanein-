### Updating the Web Application Frontend

#### 1. Add Bootstrap to the Application
When it come to creating a modern web application using modern styling, the bootstrap framework has become one of the most popular choices. We are going to use bootstrap for some basic styling. Go to https://getbootstrap.com/ and get the Include via CDN link. Add this link in between the `<head>` tags in your `index.html` as so:

```html
<head>
    <title>To-Do List</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">
</head>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that provides a wide range of styles and components for building modern web applications. By including the Bootstrap CSS file in your HTML, you can easily apply these styles to your web app.

<br/>

#### 2. Update the HTML to use Bootstrap classes
To take advantage of bootstrap we will need to make some changes to our HTML. Replace the content of the `<body>` in the `index.html` file with the following code:

>[!TIP]
>You can highlight the body code and ask Copilot to update to use bootstrap with a prompt like *update to use bootstrap styling*

```html
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="text-center my-4">To-Do List</h1>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12">
                <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
                    {% for todo in todo_list %}
                        <li class="list-group-item">{{ todo }}</li>
                    {% endfor %}
                </ol>
            </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-6">
                <form action="/add" method="post" class="my-4">
                    <div class="form-group">
                        <label for="todo">Add a to-do:</label>
                        <input type="text" name="todo" class="form-control">
                    </div>
                    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Add</button>
                </form>
            </div>
            <div class="col-6">
                <form action="/remove" method="post" class="my-4">
                    <div class="form-group">
                        <label for="item_number">Remove task number:</label>
                        <input type="number" name="item_number" min="1" class="form-control">
                    </div>
                    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-danger">Remove</button>
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
```
    
The code above uses Bootstrap classes to style the elements on the page. The container class creates a centered container for the content, while the text-center class centers the heading. The list-group and list-group-item classes create a styled list for the to-do items. The form-group and form-control classes style the form elements, and the btn and btn-primary classes style the buttons.

#### 3 Run the Application
Run the app by running ```python app.py``` in the terminal and browse to the local site. It should now look something like this:
